# What:
This is a simple Command-Line Program to randomly generate practice questions from
Launch School's PY101 curriculum questions, from the Launch School PY101 lessons and exercises.

# How to use:

1. Run the program in the command line: ```python test_generator.py```

This should output five practice questions like the following:<br>

```
	Practice question 1: answer Exercises / Easy1 / 3

	Practice question 2: answer Lesson3 / Easy2 / 8 

	Practice question 3: answer Exercises / Easy 3 / 4 

	Practice question 4: answer Lesson3 / Medium / 4 

	Practice question 5: answer Lesson3 / Hard / 4
```


2. Look up the respective questions in LaunchSchool's curriculum, 
    either in PY101 Lesson3 or in Exercises. 

3. Practice answering those questions whenever you want. 

4. Press 'N' or 'n' to stop the program; press any other key (including 'y') to generate another 5 questions.
